# Maroon-X: Radial-Velocity Spectrograph Promotional Web App

# Description

* MAROON-X is based on a two-arm KiwiSpec R4-100 spectrograph offering a wavelength coverage of 500 â€“ 900 nm at a resolving power of R~80k. The fiber feed and main optical elements are under vacuum and the VPH cross-dispersers and camera optics in pressure stabilized barrels. The beam size is compressed by a factor of 3x before entering the two cross- disperser and camera arms, allowing for a compact optical design. The spectrograph will be placed in a temperature controlled enclosure system to achieve 10 mK P-V stability at the vacuum vessel and 1 mK rms at the echelle grating.

* Dr. Andreas Seifahrt asked me to build a single-page web app to promote the Maroon-X project for the University of Chicago.

# Technology

# Deliverables

* Single-Page Web app promoting Maroon-X, a fiber-fed, optical, high-precision radial-velocity spectrograph for the 6.5m Magellan Telescope, being created at the University of Chicago.
* Seamless navigation via an intuitive nav bar.
* Integration of updates and scientific presentations about Maroon-X.
* Integration of information about the people the people on the project.
* Integration of a wavelength calibration system that can accessed in real-time via the web app.
* Integration of Image of the Day, using an API from NASA.
