      <h2>Scientific Motivation</h2>
      <p>Astronomers are on the verge of making an important step towards identifying another Earth. The discovery of an exoplanet the same size as the Earth and orbiting the same distance from its host star as Earth does the Sun is imminent. Extrapolating from existing data suggests that such narrowly defined Earth analogs will be found to be quite common. But the question of how Earth-like these planets really are will still be unanswered. This is because the nature of these planets’ atmospheres will be unknown, and planetary atmospheres are a key factor in the question of habitability.</p>

      <p>My group at the University of Chicago is leading the way in the study of the atmospheres of small exoplanets using ground- and space-based telescopes like the Magellan telescopes in Chile and the Hubble Space Telescope. Our ultimate goal is to look for the smoking gun evidence for life in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, so-called “biomarkers.”</p>

      <p>To find biomarkers in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, we have to first find Earth-size planets the right distance from their host star that are suitable for atmospheric studies. Unfortunately, the planets being ideate ed by the ongoing Kepler mission are too distant for this work. So new planet-finding experiments are needed to fill this gap.</p>

      <p>The five-year plan for my research group is centered on continuing to advance exoplanet atmosphere studies, while at the same time building and using an instrument capable of finding characterizable Earth twin candidates. We aim to have the techniques and targets ready for when NASA’s $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is operating in 2018. JWST will have the technological capability to study the atmospheres of Earth-like worlds — if we can identify suitable targets.</p>

      <p>The funding for our new planet-finding instrument is the main limitation for pursuing this program. The technology is in place, and we have the know-how to build it. The instrument will employ the radial velocity technique for finding planets and it will be used on one of the Magellan telescopes. The estimated cost is $5 million.</p>

      <p>This is the number one area in the exciting field of exoplanets where private donors can have a major impact. Five million dollars invested strategically can unlock the first discovery of life beyond our own planet. This fundamental discovery can be made by University of Chicago scientists in the next decade with your support.</p>
